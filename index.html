    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <h3>My Babysitting Philosophy</h3>
    <p>I babysit because I genuinely enjoy working with children and find it rewarding to be part of their growth and development. I value the trust families place in me and take pride in creating a safe, positive, and engaging environment for kids. Babysitting allows me to use my patience, creativity, and responsibility to make a meaningful difference in a child’s day while also supporting busy parents with peace of mind.</p>
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>I’ve been a babysitter for the past four years, caring for children ranging in age from 6 months to 11 years. I’m confident in managing up to four children at a time. In addition to my hands-on experience with a wide variety of age groups, I’m certified in both the Safe Sitter program and Wilderness Advanced First Aid (WAFA), which have strengthened my ability to stay calm, responsible, and prepared in any situation.</p>
